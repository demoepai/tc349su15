  	<h1>Life Abroad</h1>
    <h2> Konstanz</h2>
    <p>Konstanz is a city unlike any other, although some might call it more of a town than a city, it doesn’t fail to have the liveliness of any larger city. Being right along the shore of the Bodensee (or Lake Constance), Konstanz boasts a number of beautiful attractions including Insel Mainau, an island just north of the main part of Konstanz, and the beautiful harbor with ferry and boat rides to just about anywhere on the lake or Rhein river in the area. As Konstanz lies right on the border of Switzerland, the mountains are also just a short train ride away for those who like an extra adventure.</p>
<br/>
  <p>Now all of these are wonderful attractions if you’re on a trip to Konstanz, but one of the main points that I know most students would be interested in is the night life. Although from the outside Konstanz may appear a bit sleepy, it is far from that. Having two universities within the city’s borders there is constantly events being put on and students looking for entertainment.  Whether it be a sommerfest put on by the applied sciences school or a sponsored party by the main university, Konstanz is never lacking excitement. Outside of those events there is also always great deals at the bars and clubs in Konstanz as well, from Bingo at Shamrock Pub or Student nights at Berry’s students can easily find something to occupy their time on the weekends with. </p>
