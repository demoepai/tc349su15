    <p>Italy; a country with a very rich history and the remains to prove it. Seeing the Colosseum in Rome and Pompeii in Southern Italy was eye opening and an incredible glimpse into Italy’s past. Finishing every evening looking out over Sorrento and Mt. Vesuvius wasn’t a bad way to end the trip either.</p>

    <p>While in Turkey I was able to go to both Kapadokya and Istanbul, both places with some of the most unique attractions I’ve seen. With Istanbul’s lively culture and incredible historic buildings, the three days spent there were packed full of adventures. As for the Kapadokya region, the rock formations and carvings of the area are truly incredible to see – and I would highly recommend an ATV tour.</p>
